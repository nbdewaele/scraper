# README
rails version 5.1.4

Still in production - using http://adrianmcli.com/2015/05/23/rails-scraping-tutorial/ as a guide.

ebth has antiscraping policies - Will need to program frequency of GET requests and randomize client IDs.  This project is here to remind me that I want to do it but will show little progress till I complete higher priority tasks.

To get it going, simply type `rails s` in the command line.
